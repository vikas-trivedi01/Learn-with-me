## Introduction

- `Symbols` are unique and immutable identifiers, which provides high data hiding and security.
- They are highly used in custom object behaviors, API design, iterators.
- Used to avoid accidental modifications by providing way to create properties which are hidden sometimes.

### Defining Symbol

- Hence `Symbol` is a primitive data type, while creating a new `Symbol` , doesn't require **new** operator.
```Javascript
let id = Symbol();
console.log(id);

// Outputs
// Symbol()
```
- This will create a `Symbol` which is accessible by **id** variable.
- Type of `Symbol`
```Javascript
console.log( typeof(id) );

// Outputs
// symbol
```
- A description can be given to a `Symbol`.
```Javascript
let id = Symbol("This is a identifier");
console.log(id.description);

// Outputs
// This is a identifier
```

- Notice that the variable is named as **id**, which is allowed because every newly created `Symbol` is created no matter if the description is identical.

### Difference between `String` & `Symbol`
- Primarily `String` & `Symbol` are used as object's keys.
- If two strings are created which both have same content than they refer to same refernce location.
```Javascript
let s1 = "string";
let s2 = "string";

console.log( s1 == s2);

// Outputs 
// true
```

- If two symbols are created than they refer to different, unique refernce location.
```Javascript
let sym1 = Symbol();
let sym2 = Symbol();

console.log( sym1 == sym2);

// Outputs 
// false
```
- Main difference is if we use string in an object and object belongs to another code-base and there is a chance that there may be a error or confilicts.
- But using `Symbols` there is guarantee that there will be no conflicts, because `Symbols` are hidden while enumerating an object.
- Even if there is no other code-base and we different scripts and other script defines another user id, then there will be no error just because every `Symbol` is unique.
  
```Javascript
let id = Symbol("userId");
let user = {
    name : "xyz",
    [id] : 2
}

console.log(user);

// Outputs
// { 
//  name: 'xyz',
//  [Symbol(userId)]: 2
// }
```

### Global `Symbols` Registry

- There is a **Global `Symbols` Registry**, which holds `Symbols` which are shared everywhere.
- Otherwise `Symbols` are unique but when its necessary that if a `Symbol` is declared then it should be accessed rather than creating a new one.
---
- This work of creating and retrieving **Global `Symbols`** is done by a method **for()**.
- This method does that, if a **Global `Symbol`** is already created it returns that `Symbol`, otherwise it creates a new one.
```Javascript
let globalS1 = Symbol.for("global");
let localS1 = Symbol("local");

let globalS2 = Symbol.for("global");
let localS2 = Symbol("local");

console.log("Are both global symbols the same? -> " + (globalS1 == globalS2 ? "YES" : "NO"));
console.log("Are both local symbols the same? -> " + (localS1 == localS2 ? "YES" : "NO"));

// Outputs
// Are both global symbols the same? -> YES
// Are both local symbols the same? â†’ NO
```

### **for()** & **keyFor()** methods

- As discussed earlier **for()** will do work of creating and retrieving **Global `Symbols`**.
- **keyFor()** method will return name of the `Symbol` from the given `Symbol`.
```Javascript
let globalS1 = Symbol.for("global");

console.log(Symbol.for("global") ) ;
// Outputs 
// Symbol(global)

console.log(Symbol.keyFor(globalS1)) ;
// Outputs 
// global
```

  - Verifying that the symbol returned by **Symbol.for("global")** 
  - is the same as the symbol stored in globalS1, confirming that 
  - **for()** always returns the same symbol for a given key.
```Javascript
console.log(Symbol.for("global") == globalS1);
// Outputs 
// true
```
